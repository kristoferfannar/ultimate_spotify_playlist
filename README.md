# ultimate_spotify_playlist

trying to create the absolute best spotify playlist, using Spotify's API.

Plan:
Creating a playlist for a birthday party, with all the best songs according to birthday guests.
Birthday guests send their spotify playlist as a link through google forms.
I download a csv file from google forms (Playlistar/LÃ¶g.csv) with all the playlist information.
I collect all the songs in all the playlists, including which songs are most popular (in most playlists). (foldercalc.py)
From that info, I create a playlist of my own with Spotify's API, to create a playlist with all the songs in the birthday guests' playlist. (afmalis.py)
Everyone wins.

## Setting up

1.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2.  Get a spotify API token from somewhere. Place it in `.env`

3.

To grab songs into a csv from playlist links, run:

```bash
# requires SPOTIFY API TOKEN
python foldercalc.py
```

To sort through the song csv and find the most popular songs, run:

```bash
python operations.py
```

To create a new playlist with the calculations, run:

```bash
# requires SPOTIFY API TOKEN
python afmalis.py
```
