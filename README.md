# ultimate_spotify_playlist
trying to create the absolute best spotify playlist, using Spotify's API.



Plan:
    Creating a playlist for a birthday party, with all the best songs according to birthday guests.
    Birthday guests send their spotify playlist as a link through google forms. 
    I download a csv file from google forms with all the playlist information.
    I collect all the songs in all the playlists, including which songs are most popular (in most playlists).
    From that info, I create a playlist of my own with Spotify's API, to create a playlist with all the songs in the birthday guests' playlist.

    Everyone wins.
